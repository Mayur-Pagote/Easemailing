### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/easemailing.git
   cd easemailing

Install dependencies:

### 2. Code Comments

Make sure your Python code is well-commented for clarity. Hereâ€™s a guideline on how to add comments effectively:

#### General Guidelines for Code Comments

1. **Function Docstrings**: Each function should start with a docstring that describes:
   - What the function does.
   - Parameters it accepts (with types).
   - What it returns (with types).

2. **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments to explain complex logic or calculations within your functions.

#### Example: Commenting Code in `email_extraction.py`

Here's how you might add comments to your existing functions:

```python
import re
from dateutil.parser import parse

def extract_email_details(email_body):
    """
    Extracts details such as dates, times, contacts, and attachments from the given email body.
    
    Parameters:
        email_body (str): The text of the email to extract details from.
        
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing lists of extracted dates, times, contacts, and attachments.
    """
    details = {}

    # Regex pattern to find dates in formats like "1 January 2024" or "2024-01-01"
    date_pattern = r'\b(\d{1,2} [A-Za-z]+ \d{4}|\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})\b'
    dates = re.findall(date_pattern, email_body)  # Find all date matches in the email body
    if dates:
        details['dates'] = [parse(date).date() for date in dates]  # Parse and store found dates

    # Regex pattern to find times in formats like "10:00 AM"
    time_pattern = r'\b\d{1,2}:\d{2} (?:AM|PM|am|pm)\b'
    times = re.findall(time_pattern, email_body)  # Find all time matches in the email body
    if times:
        details['times'] = times  # Store found times

    # Regex pattern to find contact names in "First Last" format
    contact_pattern = r'\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\b'
    contacts = re.findall(contact_pattern, email_body)  # Find all contact names
    if contacts:
        details['contacts'] = contacts  # Store found contacts

    # Regex pattern to find file attachments mentioned in the email body
    attachment_pattern = r'\b\w+\.\w+\b'
    attachments = re.findall(attachment_pattern, email_body)  # Find all attachment names
    if attachments:
        details['attachments'] = attachments  # Store found attachments

    return details  # Return the collected details as a dictionary
